          <p class="lead">It's hard to believe that I finally have to leave the Department of Over-Enginerring this week :-(. Even after being here for 3 months now, I'm still amazed at how much insight I gain into the world from those mid-day chats we have that just spark utter enlightenment. Nowhere else am I able to even begin to grasp the complexities of politics, society, economics, and kick-ass hacker culture like I am here. Sensei Rob, you were totally right when you asked "Who's going to help you at school when you're totally lost?" Our team here is seriously BRILLIANT, and the progress we've made throughout this summer in developing our core product, scoring top merchants like Newegg and Tiger Direct, and hiring so many people that even Meagan's had a hard time keeping up with the numbers, shows that we <strong>WILL</strong> reach the moon. There isn't anywhere to go but up from here, and I'm proud to say I was able to spend an entire summer here and contribute, bit-by-bit (punny, huh? hehehe) to establishing BTC as the <em>de facto</em> currency for any and all purchases. I sincerely hope to be back again next summer, right here in the DoOE so I can pick up right where we're leaving off today. Not to mention kicking more butt on the Ping Pong leaderboard ;)<br/><br/>

          Sincerely,<br/><br/>

This internship has been unique in that almost everyone I've had the opportunity to interact with and learn from has seemed to me one of the dancers. The many impassioned conversations about bitcoin and the charged startup environment has been very inspiring.</p>

          <p class="lead">When I read in early 2013 that BitPay was moving its headquarters to Atlanta, I was excited. A major Bitcoin company was moving to my city. Just a few months later, began working as an intern. I have been working with BitPay for almost a year now, and it has been quite the year! I have witnessed the dramatic ups and downs of the market, seen how the industry works from the inside, and, most importantly, gained a great deal of knowledge about Bitcoin. I could not have done this among a finer group of individuals. All of them are dedicated and inspiring bitcoiners. I would like to thank everyone at BitPay for this wonderful experience. Most importantly, I would like to thank BitPay for offering me a full time position as a software engineer. A year and a half ago, I could not have imagined that I would be here today, but now I am certain that I have found the right place. I am eager to build the new world of crypto-finance with my peers here at BitPay. "The future's so bright, we've got to wear shades!"</p>
